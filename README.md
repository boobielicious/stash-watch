# StashWatch

**StashWatch** is a streamlined web application designed specifically to monitor and manage performer-specific video releases on Usenet. Built with TypeScript and NextJS, it provides a sleek, user-friendly interface and seamless integrations with essential media management tools.

## Why StashWatch?

While several tools exist to organize and manage media downloads, none currently specialize in performer-focused monitoring. Whisparr, for example, focuses primarily on site-based monitoring and doesn't yet support performer-specific tracking. StashWatch fills this gap by allowing users to effortlessly keep track of favorite performers, discover both new and historical releases, and manage their Usenet downloads efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Performer-Centric Monitoring:** Track and view available Usenet releases by performer.

- **Effortless Downloads:** Quickly download new or missing releases through integrated Usenet services.

- **Intelligent Download Management:** Avoid duplicates with clear visibility into previously downloaded content.

- **Customizable Blacklisting:** Easily mark unwanted releases to prevent future downloads.

- **Local Library Integration:** Identify and manage releases already stored locally in your Stash app.

- **Centralized Dashboard:** Stay informed with a unified overview of performer activity and download statuses.
